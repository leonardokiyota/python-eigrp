This is the start of a list of features that are not currently implemented.

RTP -

Missing features in RTP:
- Sequence number wrapping
- Variable retransmit timer

Wishlist for RTP:
- Allow protocol to be used over UDP (this would allow user to run a
  non-EIGRP program that uses RTP without requiring root access).
- Allow upper layer to pass in one or more TLVs to be included in the HELLO
  packet, and don't automatically include the parameter TLV by default.
  Non-EIGRP upper layers don't need the param tlv.
- Refactor TLV classes to be less complicated internally while still being as
  easy for upper layers to use.

EIGRP -

Missing features in EIGRP:
- Stuck-in-active
- PDM architecture. Only IPv4 is supported currently. Many places in the code
  that will be affected by this are annotated.
- Wide metric encoding
- Rate control (50% link utilization cap)
- External routes

Wishlist for EIGRP:
- Admin telnet console similar to the one for Python-RIPv2

General wishlist:
- Python 3 port using tulip in place of twisted
